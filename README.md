# Vec2D

A simple, *(relatively)* memory efficient, 2D grid, with safe
accessors and neighborhood iteration.

## Why this crate?

No reason at all :D

This was a toy project that I made to be a useful tool for future
projects. It was a great learning experience, and I enjoyed writing
this. I am publishing this on `crates.io` so that I can import this
into my future projects esaily with `cargo`, but if you like this, you
can use, copy, modify, or do whatever you want with it!
